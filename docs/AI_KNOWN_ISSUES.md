# Known issues

- Visual baselines were made in the Claude Code cloud container (Chromium 1243, Linux). On another
  machine the first run will differ — regenerate there with `npm run test:visual:update` before
  comparing.
- Training Studio in the visual test runs without a camera device, so it captures the
  camera-denied state, not the live stage. The live recording UI has no visual coverage yet.
- Signed-in screens (profile, history, fighter DNA) have no visual baselines; they need fixtures
  like `/visual/progress`.
- Punch detection: lead hooks 5/5 on one fighter's clips, uppercuts not detected (no clips) —
  paused by the owner.
- Push messages to real users can't be tested here (no FCM credentials in the container).
